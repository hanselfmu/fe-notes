  /*
  Native JavaScript provides ability to check the reference equality of two objects.
  What does ImmutableJS bring to the table?
  1. Mutations to an existing Immutable Object will create new Immutable Objects, not modifying the existing one.
  2. Value equality checking between two Immutable Objects.
  3. Immutable Objects can be cloned by simply creating a new reference to it,
    because any changes later on will result in new objects, not modifying existing ones.

  For React and Redux, global states can be represented using Immutable Objects (Redux actually recommends creating one single Immutable Object to hold the tree).
  When state is changed from reducer, No.1 feature will take effect, and
  new objects will be created ONLY when changed are made to these objects' values.
  Therefore, for React components, they can re-implement "shouldComponentUpdate" hook, or use PureComponent, to
  check for equality instead of a deep compare, to know that props have been updated, and they should re-render.
