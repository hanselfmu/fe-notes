    <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
    <dt>domLoading</dt><dd>The browser is about to start parsing the first received bytes of the HTML document.</dd>
    <dt>domInteractive</dt><dd>The browser has finished parsing all of the HTML and DOM construction is complete. DOM is ready.</dd>
    <dt>domContentLoaded</dt><dd>The DOM is ready, and there are no stylesheets blocking Javascript execution -- meaning the browser can now construct the render tree. Both DOM and CSSOM are ready.</dd>
    <span>Note that many browsers will start executing their own logic after domContentLoaded event "starts", and will fire "domContentLoadedEventEnd" when this execution finishes.</span>
    <dt>domComplete</dt><dd>All of the processing is complete, and all of the resources on the page have finished downloading. The loading indicator of the browser will stop now.</dd>
    <dt>loadEvent</dt><dd>This is the final step, where the browser fires an "onload" event that triggers additional <em>application logic</em>.</dd>

    <h1>Dependencies between DOM tree, Javascript, and CSS.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Synchronous JavaScript can issue a doc.write at any point; hence the DOM tree construction is blocked anytime a synchronous script is encountered;</li>
        <li>JavaScript can query for a computed style of any object, which means it can also block on CSS.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So basically, DOM construction can’t proceed until JavaScript is executed, and JavaScript can’t proceed until CSSOM is available.</p>

    <h1>Dom Interactive</h1>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#the-end">Dom Interactive steps.</a>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html">Scripting</a>
    <p>"DOM Interactive" happens after the UA stops parsing the document (including time to parse and execute all synchronous scripts).</p>
    <p>It will then do the following things AFTER it sets the document readiness to "interactive", and BEFORE it sets the document readiness to "complete":</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Close all the open elements, and pop off the "html" node on the stack (which is the topmost node).</li>
        <li>Executes all the scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing, i.e. "deferred" scripts. This involves spinning the event loop and run the scripts one by one (in the order they appear in the markup).</li>
        <li>Fire an event at the Document named "DOMContentLoaded".</li>
        <li>Spin the event loop to execute remaining scripts, i.e. "async" scripts.</li>
        <li>Set the document readiness to "complete".</li>
        <li>Fire an event named "load".</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please note that at step 2, for all the "deferred" scripts to be executed, the CSSOM needs to be ready. This means that DOMContentLoaded also signals CSSOM being ready.</p>

    <p>
        "Defer" will unblock DOMInteractive, and "async" will unblock DOMInteractive and DOMContentLoaded.
        "Defer" and "async" implicitly promise that the script will not use "document.write", which will trigger DOM tree reconstruction.

    <h1>Side Notes</h1>
    <p>Async scripts are executed in the order of download completion, regardless of markup positions.</p>
    <p>Defer scripts are executed in the order of markup positions, regardless of download completion.</p>
