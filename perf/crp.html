<p>This is a test page to illustrate impacts on CRP by different types of resources, e.g. JS, CSS, images, from different locations, e.g. head tag, or inside body tag.</p>

    <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
    <dt>domLoading</dt><dd>The browser is about to start parsing the first received bytes of the HTML document.</dd>
    <dt>domInteractive</dt><dd>The browser has finished parsing all of the HTML and DOM construction is complete. DOM is ready.</dd>
    <dt>domContentLoaded</dt><dd>The DOM is ready, and there are no stylesheets blocking Javascript execution -- meaning the browser can now construct the render tree. Both DOM and CSSOM are ready.</dd>
    <span>Note that many browsers will start executing their own logic after domContentLoaded event "starts", and will fire "domContentLoadedEventEnd" when this execution finishes.</span>
    <dt>domComplete</dt><dd>All of the processing is complete, and all of the resources on the page have finished downloading. The loading indicator of the browser will stop now.</dd>
    <dt>loadEvent</dt><dd>This is the final step, where the browser fires an "onload" event that triggers additional <em>application logic</em>.</dd>

    <p>"DOM Interactive" happens after the UA stops parsing the document.</p>
    <p>It will then do the following things BEFORE it sets the document readiness to "complete":</p>
    <ol>
        <li>close all the open elements, and pop off the "html" node on the stack (which is the topmost node).</li>
        <li>Executes all the scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing</li>
